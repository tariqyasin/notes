    "I initially carried out Abundance Matching using the Bernardi et. al 2013 GSMF and GLF. However this only contains data down to $10^9 M_\\odot$. For a scatter in the HMSM relationship of 0.2 this means anything above ~ $5 \\times 10^9 M_\\odot$ is unreliable. The Bernardi function does not behave well when extrapolated to low mass either - it actually turns over and begins decreasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GSMF from Baldry 2012 has good data down to $10^8 M_\\odot$. The Baldry function is also derived from Sersic r-band magnitudes, and is consistent with the Bernardi function in the middle mass range, for which good data exists for both. "

    "The literature is mostly concerned about the accuracy of the high end of the GSMF, where disagreement is very noticeable (see Bernardi 2013). The Bernardi function is possibly more accurate at high mass due to their efforts to account for the background of massive extended galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the low mass end there seems to be a decent amount of confidence in the Baldry 2012 result. I adopt a composite of the Bernardi and Baldry stellar mass functions, switching to Baldry below $10^9 M_\\odot$. This is similar to the method of by Kravtsov et. al 2018, except they use a combination of Baldry and Papastergis et al. (2012). Papastergis has measurements down to  $10^7 M_\\odot$. Sedgewick et. al 2019 also try and probe this down to similarly low mass, using a core-collapse supernova catalogue to take a sample of low surface brightness galaxies. They find that the number count down to $10^7 M_\\odot$ is similar to extrapolating Baldry 2012.\n"
